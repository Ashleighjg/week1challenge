## Description


I was motivated to refactor this code for accessibility optimization. This project was built to ensure that people with disabilities have the ability to access this website using assistive technology tools. I was able to clear the website of any accessiblity errors while enabling the site to rank higher in search engines. I learned how to find accessiblity errors within a website as well as correct those errors.
